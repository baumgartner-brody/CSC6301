# Project 4 & Project 5 are nearly equivalent projects with the following intents:

## Project 4:
Create a Java object deriving LinkedList such that the user can enter a list of integers and the resulting object will be sorted in ascending order.

## Project 5:
Tweak project 4 such that instead of a LinkedList the object will derive from Stack.

# As such, they have separate, but similar documentation, which can be generated with the following commands:

## Project 4:
cd project4
javadoc -d doc *.java

Documentation will be in a subdirectory named "doc"

## Project 5:
cd project5
javadoc -d doc *.java

Documentation will be in a subdirectory named "doc"
